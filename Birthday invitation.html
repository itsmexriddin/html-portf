    <p>Dear Friend,</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li><p>I am here in good health and hope the same from you. As you know my<br>
    birthday is coming on 17th of March 2025 and my parents have decided<br>
    to have a grand party on my birhday. and being you my best friend, I am <br>
    writing to invite you along. They have booked a music band to play during <br>
    the afternoon and again in the evening. Hopefully, the weather will be fine <br>
    and we can be at the outdoor for the most of the time and we will have a <br>
    marquee in care of rain andfor when it gets cooler later in the day.</p></li>

    <li><p>The party will start at 7 p.m and will probably go on till midnight. The dress <br>
    code selected is blue although any formal costume will be okay. Without <br>
    my best friend, my birthday is going to be really incomplete. I am really <br>
    excited about it and I will deeply appreciate your participation in grace <br>
    the occasion with your presence.</p></li>
    
    <li><p>We look forward to see you there to enjoy this special day wih friends<br>
    and family. Thanking you in anticipation of your favorable response.<br>
    All the best.</p></ul></li>

    <p>Loving friend,<br>
    Mexriddin Nasimjonov</p>
